				The study area focuses on three counties in Northern Minnesota, the entire Mahnomen County, the Eastern one-third Polk County, and the Western portion of Clearwater counties. The elevation of this region generally ranges from 1400 m to 1600 m, which is around 4593 feet to 5249 feet. These counties are chosen because they represent the most of the characteristics of the forest-prairie transitional boundary, also the land use history and land ownership history in this area are mainly influenced by Euro-American settlement instead of by early Indian settlement. Through using spatially balanced random sample selection tool in ArcMap, a set of sample sites were selected for detailed analysis and for representing the landscape of this forest-prairie transition region in the state. From previous fossil pollen preserved in lake sediments, scientists reconstructed the postglacial plant distribution and indicated that this area has had a long history of plant occupation since 12,000 to 13,000 years ago which is the more permanent glacier retrieval period (McAndrews, 1966). Since then, three major vegetation compositions, including pine-hardwood forest, deciduous forest and prairie, have dynamically and alternatively composed the vegetation landscape in this region (McAndrews, 1966). Amongst the deciduous forest, oak savanna commonly marks the transitional region between deciduous forest and prairie or treeless grassland. The vegetation composition dynamic corresponds not only to the climatic conditions in the continental and regional level but also to the local factors such as soils and fire regime (McAndrews, 1966).

				Analyses of pollen and charcoal in Minnesota lake sediments have shown that climate change over the past few thousand years has caused major changes in the region’s vegetation and soils; human activities add more complexities in understanding the modern day climate and natural environment of this region. During the late 19th century, approximately in the 1880s, large numbers of European immigrants started to settle in the state (McAndrews, 1978). These early settlements and land cultivation accompanied the settlement in this region have greatly changed the landscape. The Euro-American settlement in Minnesota brought in tools, farming techniques and varieties of crops to cultivate the land. Some prairie land could have been used for farming, and other lands could have been maintained as prairie for grazing cattle. According to McAndrews (1966), logging activities and deforestation changed the land cover and reduced fire frequency by reducing biomass. In the past century, some privately owned prairie and forest land were continually being farmed or logged, with some reserved for hunting purposes (Goring, 2015). Prior to the Euro-American settlement in this region, Indian settlement and land use could also have influence the vegetation distribution on the landscape in this region to a certain extent. But in this research, we will not discuss the Native Indian settlement and their influence, simply because the time period we analyze on this landscape is constrained, and Euro-Americans brought in the more drastic changes in land uses and thus more changes in vegetation; the population of Euro-Americans was also much larger than that of the Native Indians.

				The land-use change from the Euro-American settlement era could have changed the soil properties as a result of vegetation distribution change. For example, soil erodibility could have increased while soil organic matter reduced by intensive farming. This research sheds light on the soils’ interrelationships with vegetation and then reveals the soil orders that are mostly disturbed by farming land use in the past and present. Human activities such as deforestation for agriculture purposes are also related to the modern day climate change at both local and global scales (Grimm, 1984). For example, the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources recently reported that the warmer climate has increased the growing season by about a month, which could increase agricultural production, especially of corn. This in-depth research will be important for understanding how human activities have influenced or changed the natural environment, including the soils and vegetation on a local scale, in order to understand how local and global climates are in turn impacted by human activities.

	        	This research mainly focuses on understanding the interrelationships of the land use, vegetation patterns, and soils in Northern Minnesota through three aspects: 1) through comparing the land use patterns during the Euro-American period to the modern days, uncovering the kinds of vegetation types that are mainly disturbed; 2) predicting how the changes in vegetation could further influence soils or whether the changes to vegetation are related to soils; 3) examining the expansions and recessions of different types of agriculture activities, in order to make sense of the patterns of land use change.

				Understanding the interactions among these topics lays a good foundation for future exploration of soils’ carbon storage capacity. Active research shows both that soil is an important reservoir of carbon that can be released as CO2 into the atmosphere, and that human interactions with soils through land use, such as establish settlement and agriculture, could impact the carbon-storing capacity of soils. Sanderman et al.(2017) used machine learning-based model to analyze the global soil organic carbon loss (SOC) and have concluded that large extent of agricultural and grazing land use has been generating large global carbon debt; agriculture alone generated a global carbon debt of 133 Pg C for the top 2m of soil, and the trend has been increasing dramatically in the past 200 years. Thus, human land use could have positive feedback on climate warming. As the climate gets warmer, growing seasons are longer; as more forest and prairie land being cleared and used for agriculture to increase production yield, soils in the region could become more erodible and thus lead to soil organic matter loss (McAndrews, 1988). This could have a series of subsequent negative influences. For example, the reduction of soil carbon storage capacity could result in a net increase in CO2 emissions, increasing warming; this could also make extreme rainfall events or droughts more common at the local scale. With lower organic carbon content, the soils will also be more vulnerable to erosion by heavy rainfall. In order to reduce the extent of or eliminate these potentially negative influences, local landowners and government agencies need to understand the effects of settlement history on soils and natural vegetation in Northern Minnesota. Such an understanding helps them make more environment-friendly land use decisions and adopt more effective land management policies to avoid depleting the soil and vegetation resources - for example, allowing some fields to fall fallow intermittently and reducing the intensity of multiple cropping to avoid exhausting the organic matter in soils.
