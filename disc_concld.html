			<h2><span>&#167;</span> Discussion</h2>
			<p>
				When working with the historical aerial photos, the biggest challenge encountered relates to its coarse spatial resolution and that they are black-and-white films. Errors were inevitably introduced when we georeference them against the modern day aerial photos by selecting control points at road intersections or other more stable features on the ground which is a common approach for control points. However, roads were generally wider and straighter in modern days than in than the 1930s, therefore putting the control points at the road intersections when working with historical photos could be biased. Similarly, in digitization of land cover, textures of forest or pastures are harder to distinguish. Some darker patches on the images that we identified as water could be stains due to the improper preservation of the films. Although these biases exist, they are minor and usually offset each other in the final results; our georeferencing and digitization procedures and decision makings stayed consist of the 10 points which also minimizes the bias. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Another question regarding the aerial photos that needs to be addressed is that these photos are taken from the 1930s; they are the earliest imagery captured of this area that provides realistic and objective description of the landscape. Even though they are not images taken during the settlement period, it is appropriate to use them because the settlement is a long process. Landowners in this region usually do not abandon the land they have already settled on. Even if the land was abandoned, there is evidence such as fences, buildings, or plowed land left could be identified on the 1930’s images.

			<h2><span>&#167;</span> Conclusion</h2>
			<p>
				In this study, we have identified the types of vegetation and soils that were influenced and changed by Euro-American settlement in Northern Minnesota over the past two centuries. We also examined how each land use type has changed and how much has changed. Through this research, the understanding of the human settlement and their land use preference in relation to soil orders has been deepened, thus, helps to predict the disturbance to and change of soils in this region. It also sheds light on the dynamics of vegetation and soils in this unique transition boundary by revealing the mismatch between vegetation and soils and predicts the direction of future vegetation expansion. Agriculture statistics are included to explain the land use change we observed, as well as predicting if the agriculture continues to expand due to the longer growing season and new agriculture technology, how much land that is now prairie or forest would be converted to farmland. Moreover, now much of the land in Northern Minnesota is privately owned, with some owned by government or tribes; if these land were used for agriculture or other human-settlement related land use, soils will surely respond to this change. However, which soil properties would be altered the most, how are these land use change influencing different soils? How soil’s carbon storage capacity is changed in response to land use change in this regions? These topics need further investigation to extend the discussion on soils’ role in the entire interaction among human settlement and vegetation further.
