				<tr>
					<td>3/14</td><td>Lecture on Copyright</td><td>2,5 hours</td><td>It is very new for me to start thinking about the legal issues related to onlien sources. and how I should be crediting them. However, the content in this project is original. Except the imagey on the bottom, which has been credited.</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>3/15</td><td>Unicode/HTML</td><td>2,5 hours</td><td>The lecture has stressed on the history and revolution of brwosers and html's compatibility. This raised my attention to the browsers that I use to host my website. Unicode is also proven to be helpful knowing the special characters are denoted by numeric values. This later proven to be useful in terms of displaying the section sign on each page. </td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>3/22</td><td>CSS</td><td>2,5 hours</td><td>Even though I was not able to attend the lecture, but as I was reviewing the material covered, I learned very useful ways of selecting different elements on html using css that I was not familiar with before. The section on open source fonts are also very helpful for choosing fonts for this project. </td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>4/8</td><td>Finish writing all the htmls, except the tables </td><td>4 hours</td><td>This is when I copied and pasted in all the content of the website from my thesis work. I also determined how to arrange the sections on my webpage, created each webpage and linked them together. </td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>4/13</td><td>Edit and style the tables in Methods section </td><td>2 hours</td><td>Since there were four tables in my original thesis, I decided to include them on the page as well. But it took no time for me to notice how messy and tedius it is to formulate a table in html. Styling tables in css is very easy, but inputting values for each cell without the functionality of copying anf pasting it very challenging and requires lots of attention. </td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>4/15</td><td>Styling the entire site </td><td>5 hours</td><td>I have decided to finish the stylings for the entire site in one setting. It proves that maybe it would be a better idea to do it in more than one setting. Nevertheless, I was able to utilize the material from the CSS lecture to efficiently select grouped and individual elements and then style them. Finding aesthetic fonts and complementary fonts is actually a very fun task. </td>
